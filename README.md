## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Cube CSS methodology


### What I learned

- This challenge was quite a good one. It took far more testing than I've ever done before. Blame the old designer eyes for noticing the details everytime I thought I was done.
- Had to review about layouts and containers in the process when after all was done, the layout wouldn't resize correctly. However, this helped to notice the way they work, especially when applying semantic HTML.
- Relearning about validation on JavaScript was yet another thing. I highly recommend reviewing form validation if you have your doubts on where to even start before hitting this challenge.

### Continued development

I'm definitely looking forward to more challenges like this one, it was a test of both knowledge, problem-solving skills and patience with myself, also it gave me further reference on how to manage my work time in a healthy way.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks | Sticky Footer, Five Ways](https://css-tricks.com/couple-takes-sticky-footer/) - Quite helpful when rethinking the responsive layout.
- [GeeksforGeeks | JavaScript Form Validation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/form-validation-using-javascript/) - This served as a good example to work on the JavaScript file. 
- [MDN | Outline](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/outline) - This was helpful to work on the focus state required.
